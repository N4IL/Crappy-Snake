# Crappy-Snake
A crappy version of snake made in C/C++ to be played in the windows terminal

# Purpose
This was/is a simple project done for my first program, as I am currently learning C/C++ to prepare for my major when I begin attending University.
I didn't really have very high goals for this project other than to simply recreate the original snake, which I have achieved.

# What Next?
I am soon going to begin working on another simple game, but of my own hopefully semi-original idea.
I don't have high aspirations for the art or polish of the game, but hopefully I can continue work on it later.
